# University
This repository contains all the appropriate assignments done throughout the years in University, notably the code oriented ones. The context of the repository are:

  1) Sequential Programming (C). As the name suggests the first coding class encountered in Uni introduces to us the wonders of sequential programming through C          programming language.
  2) Data Structures (C). Using C language we learnt all about the most usefull and popular data structures and their use cases.
  3) Object Oriented Programming (Java). This time we engage into object oriented programming on one of the most interesting languages there is Java.
  4) Parallel and Distributed Programming (Java). This class was all about the optimization of given codes using threads (Parallel) or messages (Distributed) to make them run on less time. 
  5) Machine learning. My first two (of many) project assignments
  6) Neural networks. Same as above ðŸ‘†
